# FindHDEEM - tries to find the hdeem library.
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# On success, this module defines the following variables:
#   HDEEM_INCLUDE_DIRS              -   The path to find hdeem.h in.
#   HDEEM_LIBRARIES                 -   The path to find libhdeem.so in.
#
# This module will try to find hdeem in some standard paths but you can give a hint with the
# following variable:
#   HDEEM_ROOT_DIR                  -   A path to look for hdeem. Can be set as a parameter for
#                                       CMake or as an environment variable.

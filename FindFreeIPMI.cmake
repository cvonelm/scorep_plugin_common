# FindFreeIPMI - tries to find the FreeIPMI library.
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# On success, this module defines the following variables:
#   FreeIPMI_INCLUDE_DIRS           -   The path to find freeIPMI.h in.
#   FreeIPMI_LIBRARIES              -   The path to find libfreeIPMI.so in.
#
# This module will try to find freeIPMI in some standard paths but you can give a hint with the
# following variable:
#   FreeIPMI_ROOT_DIR               -   A path to look for freeIPMI. Can be set as a parameter for
#                                       CMake or as an environment variable.
